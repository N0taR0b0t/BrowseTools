This includes job approval ratings for President Donald Trump and Congress, evaluations of the U.S. economy, satisfaction with the direction of the country, and perceptions of the most important problem facing the nation. Forty-three percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job, essentially unchanged from his ratings in March and April after slipping from his second-term high of 47% in late January. Trump\u2019s 43% job approval rating reflects 90% approval from his fellow Republicans versus 4% from Democrats, both in line with prior readings. Only independents\u2019 views of Trump have changed meaningfully this year, now at 33% but down from 46% in January. The start of the May 1-18 poll coincided with \u201cMay Day\u201d rallies across the country opposing Trump administration policies, particularly on immigration, federal spending and workforce cuts. It ended shortly after Trump returned from a four-day visit to the Arab Gulf region, where he announced several diplomatic and investment deals. Economic news was mixed over the course of the poll, including further gains on Wall Street after a nine-day winning streak for the S&P 500 that ended May 2, and as progress was made on some trade agreements, but spanning weak GDP and consumer spending reports. Approval of Congress is 26% this month, similar to April\u2019s 28% but down from 31% in March. This year\u2019s congressional ratings, lifted by relatively high Republican approval (49%) of the GOP-led body, are the highest Gallup has seen since early 2021, when Democrats were highly positive about the then-Democratic-controlled Congress at the start of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the way things are going in the country has also been elevated this year because of Republican enthusiasm. The 38% currently satisfied reflects 79% satisfaction from Republicans \u2014 near the record high for the GOP \u2014 versus 31% from independents and 4% from Democrats. U.S. satisfaction hasn\u2019t been higher since registering above 40% in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the U.S. Poor Governance, Immigration and Economic Concerns Fuel Dissatisfaction As Americans offer tepid ratings of their national leaders and the country\u2019s direction, they provide some indication of what is troubling them in their answers to Gallup\u2019s question about the most important problem facing the nation. Overall, more Americans cite noneconomic than economic issues as the top problem facing the country, 70% versus 35%. The top noneconomic issue named is poor governance or leadership, cited by 26%, followed by immigration, at 13%. While both of those perceptions are in line with prior readings this year, the percentage citing the judicial system or courts, in third at 5%, has ticked up from 2% in January. Race relations or racism ties for third among noneconomic problems. Regarding economic issues, 16% of Americans identify \u201cthe economy\u201d in general terms as their primary concern, while 8% say inflation and 4% name foreign trade or the trade deficit. Inflation is at the low end of this year's 8% to 12% range, while the 4% mentioning trade is one of the higher percentages ever mentioning this. Republicans are most likely to mention immigration, at 25%, while Democrats (43%) and independents (23%) are focused primarily on poor government/leadership. Men and women mention government, immigration and inflation to a similar degree, while men are slightly more likely than women to say the economy in general is the top problem.",

      "content": "Leadership Leadership Strategies Economic Forecast Update, May 2025: A Short Rocky Road By Bill Conerly, Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Bill Conerly connect the dots between the economy... and business! Follow Author May 06, 2025, 07:30am EDT\n\nShare Save Comment 0 Historical data from Bureau of Economic Analysis; forecast from Dr. Bill Conerly Dr. Bill Conerly The economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter, according to the official report on Gross Domestic Product. Widespread worry about consumers and businesses postponing purchases and hiring decisions has led economists to raise their estimated risk of recession, the Wall Street Journal reported in April. Yet the economic outlook is not bad if decisions on tariffs are concluded this summer. That\u2019s true even if the tariffs end up significantly above last year\u2019s rates. The key elements of the economic forecast include the solid growth we achieved in 2024, which provided a good foundation for this year. Most policy changes other than tariffs will have small impacts on the short-run economic forecast, some positive and some negative but the sum total very small. And the Federal Reserve has good plans for tariff-induced price hikes. The U.S. economy simply needs to get through the tariff uncertainty without major damage. GDP Decline In Q1 The GDP report does not mark the start of a recession, in all probability. The first GDP report is labeled \u201cAdvance Estimate,\u201d which the Bureau of Economic Analysis says is \u201cbased on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision.\u201d The average revision, ignoring whether it\u2019s upward or downward, is 0.7%. Thus, the -.3% Advance Estimate may well be revised significantly. PROMOTED The details of the report do suggest revisions. Imports rose significantly in Q1, as people and businesses bought in anticipation of tariffs. This data is pretty accurate by a month after the end of the quarter, when the Advance Estimate is released. Imports are subtracted in the GDP calculation, to remove them from figures for spending as well as inventory increases. But inventory increases are not so accurate, and with a surge of imports, it is quite possible that some goods were in transit from the port to the buyer and not counted in anyone\u2019s inventory. The spending figures are also estimates based on surveys of businesses. A large upward revision at the end of May is quite possible, concentrated in inventory change with also some spending increases. Thus, the negative GDP change should not be taken as a portent of looming disaster. Most Policy Changes Minor Before considering tariffs, three other policy areas should be addressed. Immigration control will limit population growth, as it did in the first Trump administration. This will lower job growth in low-skilled occupations, hitting farming, food processing, construction, housekeeping and restaurant cooking. The border control will not weaken the economy, but it will remove a small positive increment to the growth rate.

The job cuts will have negligible impact on the overall economy, though they will certainly affect the people involved. Payroll is a minor part of the total federal budget, and even though people have been laid off, the money for the departments has been appropriated and current law requires the president to spend it. The labor market is fairly tight, so most government workers will be absorbed into other parts of the economy. Deregulation is the other policy change that will impact the economy. Although some action can be taken through executive orders, most require a multi-year rule-making process. Deregulation will enable more construction projects, but very little in the next two years.

      "content": "April 28, 2025 Introduction Despite multiple winter storms in January creating a drag early in the quarter, February and March saw stronger performance, indicating that economic growth likely continued in the first quarter of 2025, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter. Meanwhile, labor markets picked up strength at the end of the first quarter, recovering from storm-ridden January: as of March, private-sector employers added 325,000 jobs during the first two months of this Administration. In addition, inflation reads for February and March were favorable owing to downward pressures from energy prices and core goods, as well as significantly slower inflation for key core consumer services. On balance, economic data for the first quarter illustrated the U.S. economy is poised to continue growing while seeing inflation return to its pre-pandemic target. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Official data on real GDP growth in the first quarter will not be available until after this week\u2019s TBAC meeting. According to the most recent publicly available survey (the Wall Street Journal survey published on April 12, 2025), the median forecast for first-quarter GDP growth is 0.4 percent at an annual rate, slowing from 2024 Q4\u2019s 2.4 percent pace. In the survey, estimates of forecasters at the 25th and 75th percentiles ranged from 0.1 percent to 1.0 percent. This survey closed before April 9 when President Trump announced a 90-day pause in implementing reciprocal tariffs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP growth on Wednesday, April 30. Labor Markets Although aggregate labor market data have eased at the margins, the anticipated slowdown in hiring has been gradual, unemployment rates remain relatively stable, and the headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) stabilized in the first quarter (see Table 1 \u2013 Labor Market Indicators). Total payroll job growth slowed to an average 152,000 per month during the first quarter of 2025, after accelerating to an average 209,000 per month during last year\u2019s final quarter. Following outsized gains in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, the pace of hiring has eased in recent years to mirror population growth and demographic changes, helping to keep unemployment rates stable. Over the past eleven months, monthly unemployment rates have fluctuated within a narrow range of 4.0 percent and 4.2 percent. For the past two quarters, the unemployment rate has averaged 4.1 percent per month, a rate that is near estimates by the Congressional Budget Office of the non-cyclical unemployment rate\u2014or the rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation and excludes fluctuations in aggregate demand. As of March 2025, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2 percent, remaining within the nearly yearlong range. Labor force participation was also relatively stable during the first quarter. After easing to an average 62.5 percent during the fourth quarter, the overall LFPR remained at that level in the subsequent quarter, just a tick below the reading for the whole of 2024. The LFPR among prime-age workers edged down 0.1 percentage points to 83.4 percent during the first quarter, after a four-fold decline in the previous quarter. Even so, participation among this demographic remained relatively sturdy: March\u2019s reading was 0.2 percentage points above the peak reached just before the pandemic and only 0.6 percentage points below the 23-year high realized last summer. Among prime-age men, the LFPR was 89.1 percent in March, or 0.8 percentage points below the 15-year high reached in July 2024. Meanwhile, participation among those aged 55 or older remains remarkably stable despite broader demographic trends: for the past five quarters, the quarterly average LFPR for this group has remained within a range of 38.2 percent and 38.5 percent and stood at 38.2 percent as of March 2025. Other measures of labor demand, which had shown a declining trend in previous quarters, also stabilized in the first quarter. At the end of last September, job openings were at 7.1 million, the lowest level since December 2020; however, average monthly job openings stood at 7.7 million during the first two months of 2025, matching the fourth quarter\u2019s monthly average.",

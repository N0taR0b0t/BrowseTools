      "content": "HOME Why Rady Rady News 2025 Congressional Stock Trading Severely Undermines Public Trust and Compliance with the Law\n\nCongressional Stock Trading Severely Undermines Public Trust and Compliance with the Law When the voting public is exposed to reports of lawmakers' stock trades, it erodes the perceived legitimacy of Congress across party lines. Greggory DiSalvo / iStock A new study from the Rady School of Management reveals that public exposure to reports of Congressional stock trading significantly reduces Americans\u2019 trust in Congress and their willingness to comply with the law \u2014 regardless of political affiliation. The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which was conducted in January 2025, used an online sample of more than 1,000 U.S. citizens. Participants were shown a nonpartisan report with real-world data from watchdog organization Unusual Whales, detailing how certain members of Congress consistently outperformed the stock market. Compared to a control group that received neutral information on the colleges that congress members attended, those exposed to the report were significantly more likely to view Congress as corrupt, self-serving, and less legitimate \u2014 and were less willing to follow laws passed by Congress as a result. \u201cWe found that simply learning about this kind of trading was enough to erode trust,\u201d said first author Raihan Alam, a doctoral student in management at the Rady School of Management. What was even more striking was that the effect wasn\u2019t about profit. In a follow-up study, the team showed different participants fictional scenarios involving a \u201cCongressman Brown,\u201d who engaged in questionable stock trades. In one version, he made a million dollars. In another, he lost that same amount. Regardless of the outcome, trust plummeted. \u201cThis told us something important,\u201d said coauthor Tage Rai, an assistant professor of management at the Rady School of Management. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the money. It\u2019s the perception that lawmakers are using their power for personal gain. Even if they fail at it \u2014 just the attempt is enough to undermine legitimacy.\u201d First author Raihan Alam, a doctoral student in management at the Rady School of Management and corresponding author Tage Rai, an assistant professor of management at the Rady School of Management, discuss the implications of their study on Congressional stock trading. Cracks in American Exceptionalism Gallup reported in 2024 that trust in Congress had dipped to just 22% and the authors of the paper believe it may be falling even further \u2014 especially after recent revelations of trading that occurred on April 9, which raised questions about insider access. For example, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene made a $300,000 stock trade a mere 90 minutes before Trump announced he was pausing tariffs on most of the U.S.\u2019 trading partners, after which the stock markets soared. \u201cFor years, political scientists have asked why some countries function well and others don\u2019t,\u201d said Rai. \u201cOne key difference is public trust in institutions. America used to be the poster child for that \u2014 people believed if they played by the rules, the system would work.\u201d A Bipartisan Problem with a Bipartisan Solution The researchers emphasize that the findings have important policy implications. \u201cMore than 86% of Democrats and Republicans alike support banning stock trading in Congress,\u201d said Alam. \u201cThis is a rare issue where both the public and bipartisan lawmakers are aligned.\u201d Current proposals, such as the Trust in Congress Act, include mandating assets to be placed in blind trusts. The bill earned support from current and former representatives, Katie Porter (D-CA) Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Ro Khanna (D-CA). The researchers suggest such reforms could serve as powerful \u201ccredibility-enhancing displays\u201d \u2014 costly signals that lawmakers are committed to acting in the public interest. Implications for Democracy The broader message of the research is a warning: declining trust in Congress could translate into declining compliance with the law \u2014 a foundational element of democratic governance. \u201cWhen people no longer believe their leaders are acting fairly, it becomes harder for them to justify following the rules,\u201d said Rai. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a political problem.",

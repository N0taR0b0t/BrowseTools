The entrepreneur told Wall Street analysts on April 22 that he would be \u201csignificantly\u201d scaling back his work with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more on Tesla. Beginning in May, the 53-year-old will only work for DOGE one to two days per week \u201cfor as long as the president would like me to do so.\u201d This decision comes amid a drastic plummet in Tesla\u2019s sales, with the company\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report showing a 71 percent drop in profits. The electric vehicle company has been the target of widespread protests and boycotts in recent months, largely in response to Musk\u2019s role in DOGE\u2019s elimination of thousands of federal jobs. While reassuring investors about his commitment to Tesla, he also addressed the impact that tariffs could have on the cost of their cars, noting that his position differs from President Donald Trump \u2019s recent moves. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can do.\u201d Jump to: Who Is Elon Musk?

ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer Where Is Elon Musk From? Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a CoverGirl campaign. When Elon was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Elon\u2019s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer. Elon spent his early childhood with his brother, Kimbal, and sister, Tosca, in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10. Around this time, Musk developed an interest in computers and taught himself how to program. When he was 12 years old, Musk developed his own game called Blastar that he sold for $500. He was often so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. The short, introverted, and bookish child was bullied until he was 15. By that point, he went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. He has continued to practice martial arts as an adult. At age 17, in 1988, Elon moved to Canada against his parents\u2019 wishes to attend university and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. He obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain U.S. citizenship via that path. Elon moved to the United States a few years later and officially became an American citizen in 2002.",

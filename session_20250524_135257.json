On January 15, 2009, the Airbus A320 serving the flight struck a flock of birds shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia, losing all engine power. Given their position in relation to the available airports and their low altitude, pilots Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles decided to glide the plane to ditching on the Hudson River near Midtown Manhattan. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] All 155 people on board were rescued by nearby boats. There were no fatalities, although 100 people were injured, 5 of them seriously. The time from the bird strike to the ditching was less than four minutes. The then-Governor of New York State, David Paterson, called the incident a \" Miracle on the Hudson \" [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official described it as \"the most successful ditching in aviation history\". [ 5 ] Flight simulations showed that the aircraft could have returned to LaGuardia, had it turned toward the airport immediately after the bird strike. [ 6 ] However, the NTSB found that the scenario did not account for real-world considerations, and affirmed the ditching as providing the highest probability of survival, given the circumstances. [ 7 ]: 89 The pilots and flight attendants were awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in recognition of their \"heroic and unique aviation achievement\". [ 8 ] Background [ edit ] On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 [ a ] with call sign \"CACTUS 1549\" was scheduled to fly from New York City's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, with a planned intermediate stop at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) in Charlotte, North Carolina. The aircraft was an Airbus A320-214 powered by two CFM International CFM56-5B4/P turbofan engines. [ 9 ] [ b ] The pilot in command was 57-year-old Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, a former fighter pilot who had been an airline pilot since leaving the United States Air Force in 1980. At the time, he had logged 19,663 total flight hours, including 4,765 in an A320; he was also a glider pilot and expert on aviation safety.",

Five people were seriously injured, but there were no fatalities. The airplane, an Airbus A320 operated by US Airways, took off from LaGuardia at approximately 3:25 pm. It was destined for Charlotte, North Carolina. On board were 5 crew members, including Capt. Chesley (\u201cSully\u201d) Sullenberger III, and 150 passengers. About two minutes into the flight, the airplane flew into a flock of Canada geese. Both engines were severely damaged, causing an almost complete loss of thrust. Repeated attempts to restart the engines were unsuccessful. Sullenberger notified LaGuardia\u2019s air control that he was returning to the airport. However, as the plane continued to descend in a glide, Sullenberger believed that it would be unable to reach LaGuardia. An airport in New Jersey was also quickly ruled out. Shortly thereafter he notified air control that he was going to attempt a very risky and rare water landing, in the Hudson River. At approximately 3:29 pm, Sullenberger announced over the intercom \u201cThis is the captain. Brace for impact.\u201d Britannica Quiz Disasters of Historic Proportion Some 3 1 / 2 minutes after colliding with the birds, the plane landed in the river. The fuselage\u2019s aft end made first contact, and that section suffered severe damage, notably a rupture that allowed water to enter the aircraft. However, the plane remained buoyant, thanks in part to the fuel tanks, which were not full. Passengers and crew then exited the plane via the forward slide/rafts and walked onto the wings or entered inflatable rafts. Local ferries and emergency responders were on the scene within minutes. A number of the passengers were treated for hypothermia, but only five people suffered more serious injuries. Notably a flight attendant was cut on the leg during the landing and required surgery. While Sullenberger became a national hero to many, some were critical of his decision to land in the Hudson River.",

Publications (19) Topometric localization on a road network Article October 2014 \u00b7 48 Reads \u00b7 20 Citations Danfei Xu \u00b7 Hernan Badino \u00b7 Daniel Huber Current GPS-based devices have difficulty localizing in cases where the GPS signal is unavailable or insufficiently accurate. This paper presents an algorithm for localizing a vehicle on an arbitrary road network using vision, road curvature estimates, or a combination of both. The method uses an extension of topometric localization, which is a hybrid between topological and metric localization. The extension enables localization on a network of roads rather than just a single, non-branching route. The algorithm, which does not rely on GPS, is able to localize reliably in situations where GPS-based devices fail, including 'urban canyons' in downtown areas and along ambiguous routes with parallel roads. We demonstrate the algorithm experimentally on several road networks in urban, suburban, and highway scenarios. We also evaluate the road curvature descriptor and show that it is effective when imagery is sparsely available. Read more Understanding how camera configuration and environmental conditions affect appearance-based localization Conference Paper June 2014 \u00b7 69 Reads \u00b7 30 Citations Aayush Bansal \u00b7 Hernan Badino \u00b7 Daniel Huber Localization is a central problem for intelligent vehicles. Visual localization can supplement or replace GPS-based localization approaches in situations where GPS is unavailable or inaccurate. Although visual localization has been demonstrated in a variety of algorithms and systems, the problem of how to best configure such a system remains largely an open question. Design choices, such as \u201cwhere should the camera be placed?\u201d and \u201chow should it be oriented?\u201d can have substantial effect on the cost and robustness of a fielded intelligent vehicle. This paper analyzes how different sensor configuration parameters and environmental conditions affect visual localization performance with the goal of understanding what causes certain configurations to perform better than others and providing general principles for configuring systems for visual localization. We ground the investigation using extensive field testing of a visual localization algorithm, and the data sets used for the analysis are made available for comparative evaluation. Read more Visual Odometry by Multi-frame Feature Integration Conference Paper December 2013 \u00b7 125 Reads \u00b7 140 Citations Hern\u00e1n Badino \u00b7 Akihiro Yamamoto \u00b7 Takeo Kanade This paper presents a novel stereo-based visual odometry approach that provides state-of-the-art results in real time, both indoors and outdoors. Our proposed method follows the procedure of computing optical flow and stereo disparity to minimize the re-projection error of tracked fea ture points. However, instead of following the traditional approach of performing this task using only consecutive frames, we propose a novel and computationally inexpensive technique that uses the whole history of the tracked feature points to compute the motion of the camera. In our technique, which we call multi-frame feature integration, the features measured and tracked over all past frames are integrated into a single, improved estimate. An augmented feature set, composed of the improved estimates, is added to the optimization algorithm, improving the accuracy of the computed motion and reducing ego-motion drift. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces pose error by up to 65% with a negligible additional computational cost of 3.8%. Furthermore, our algorithm outperforms all other known methods on the KITTI Vision Benchmark data set.

A Friday, May 23 average of recent polls from the New York Times gives the second-term president a 45% approval rating, with 51% disapproving of his performance. The outlet's approval rating average has held steady between 44%-45% over the last 30 days, but it does show a downward trend for the president since early March. Pollster Nate Silver's \"Silver Bulletin\" newsletter showed the president reached his best approval figures since early April this week, settling in with a 46% approval and 50% disapproval on May 23. RealClearPolitics' average was more than a percentage point higher, calculating a 47.7% approval and 49.3% disapproval rating. Polling: More Americans oppose Trump's tax plan than support it, survey says Trump began his term with a 47% approval rating, according to Gallup, and saw his popularity dip through his 100th day in office, when his job approval numbers reached historic lows not seen by any other president over the past several decades. While his lowest average approval numbers sank to the low-40s, the Republican leader has seen a slight uptick in approval rating metrics since late April. His highest average, Gallup's analysis says, is 49%, just shy of that benchmark. A historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in April 2017 and April 2025 \u2212 roughly marking his first 100 days in office \u2212 reached lows unseen by any other modern president. Trump news recap In the past week, Trump told Walmart to \"eat the tariffs\" after the company said it would increase prices due to the president's higher import duties, and he signed a law aimed at combatting revenge porn and deep fakes. The Republican leader also presented disinformation to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to further a right-wing conspiracy that the country is committing genocide against White farmers, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a piece of mega-legislation dubbed the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" by the president for its Republican-backed legislative priorities.
